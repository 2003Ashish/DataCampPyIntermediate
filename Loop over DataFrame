1. Write a for loop that iterates over the rows of cars and on each iteration perform two print() calls: one to print out the row label and one to print out all of the rows contents.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Iterate over rows of cars
for lab, row in cars.iterrows():
    print(lab)
    print(row)
    
2. Using the iterators lab and row, adapt the code in the for loop such that the first iteration prints out "US: 809", the second iteration "AUS: 731", and so on.
   The output should be in the form "country: cars_per_cap". Make sure to print out this exact string (with the correct spacing).
   You can use str() to convert your integer data to a string so that you can print it in conjunction with the country label.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Adapt for loop
for lab, row in cars.iterrows() :
    print("{}: {}".format(lab,row["cars_per_cap"]))
