1. Write a for loop that goes through each key:value pair of europe. On each iteration, "the capital of x is y" should be printed out, where x is the key and y is the value of the pair.

# Definition of dictionary
europe = {'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 'germany':'berlin',
          'norway':'oslo', 'italy':'rome', 'poland':'warsaw', 'austria':'vienna' }
          
# Iterate over europe

for key, value in europe.items():
    print("the capital of {} is {}".format(key,value))
    
 2. Import the numpy package under the local alias np.
    Write a for loop that iterates over all elements in np_height and prints out "x inches" for each element, where x is the value in the array.
    Write a for loop that visits every element of the np_baseball array and prints it out.
    
# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# For loop over np_height
for i in np_height:
    print("{} inches".format(i))

# For loop over np_baseball
for i in np.nditer(np_baseball):
    print(i)
