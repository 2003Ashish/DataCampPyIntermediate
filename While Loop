1. Code a while loop that keeps running as long as offset is not equal to 0. Inside the while loop:
   Print out the sentence "correcting...".
  Next, decrease the value of offset by 1. You can do this with offset = offset - 1.
  Finally, still within your loop, print out offset so you can see how it changes.

# Initialize offset
offset = 8

# Code the while loop
while offset!=0:
    print("correcting...")
    offset = offset - 1
    print(offset)
    
 2. Inside the while loop, complete the if-else statement:
    If offset is greater than zero, you should decrease offset by 1.
    Else, you should increase offset by 1.
    
# Initialize offset
offset = -6

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    if offset > 0:
      offset = offset - 1
    else : 
      offset = offset + 1   
    print(offset)
